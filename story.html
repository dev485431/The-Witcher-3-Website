                    The opening cutscene depicts Yennefer fleeing some unknown danger in the midst of a large
                    battle and Geralt and Vesemir several days later tracking her escape from various signs left in her
                    wake. At the scene's conclusion the story officially starts with Geralt in a guest room at Kaer
                    Morhen, the stronghold of the witchers in the Blue Mountains. After proceeding through brief
                    tutorials on
                    movement and combat mechanics, and the sudden and terrifying appearance of the Wild Hunt, we learn
                    that the time Geralt is actually dreaming the events at Kaer Morhen. Geralt awakes to discuss his
                    dream
                    with Vesemir and they resume their tracking of Yennefer's flight as seen in the opening scene.

                    Quaint village of White Orchard shows signs of the scars of war
                    Vesemir and Geralt make their way to White Orchard where they learn that Yennefer was last seen
                    speaking
                    with the Nilfgaardian captain before she raced off. The captain agrees to tell Geralt where Yennefer
                    went in exchange for ridding the town of a griffin that has recently been attacking villagers on the
                    main road. Geralt examines the beast's nest and sets a trap for the griffin and with the help of
                    Vesemir
                    soon defeats the griffin. The nilfgaardian captain says that Yennefer has rode on to Vizima. Just as
                    Geralt and Vesemir are about to depart they are approached by none other than Yennefer herself.
                    Yennefer
                    insists that Geralt follow her back to Vizima for an audience with the emperor Emhyr var Emreis.
                    Vesemir
                    decides it would be best if he returned to Kaer Morhen.

                    Geralt and Yen discuss the plan to find Ciri
                    Even when crossing the short distance between White Orchard and Vizma, Geralt and Yennefer cannot
                    have a
                    quiet moment as they are soon set upon by hounds of the Wild Hunt. Fortunately for our hero no harm
                    comes to either Geralt or Yennefer and they arrive safely in Vizima where Emperor Emhyr enlists
                    Geralt's
                    aid in finding the emperor's daughter Ciri who is believed to have the Wild Hunt closing in on her.
                    Geralt agrees to help and meets with Yennefer to formulate a plan. Geralt intends to begin his
                    search in
                    Velen and meet with Triss Merigold to join forces in the search. Meanwhile Yennefer departs to
                    investigate a magical disturbance in Skellige that might be linked to Ciri.
